# CodeClause_Brain_Tumor_Detection
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in the brain or central spine that can disrupt proper brain function. It is the abnormal growth of tissues in brain. Brain Tumor Detection Project using Python and its libraries involves the use of image processing techniques to detect tumors in MRI brain scans. It requires opencv and tensorflow libraries. For detecting the tumor we use the GUI and to view the tumor region and the tensorflow model can be used to detect if the MRI image contains tumor or not.he project can be extended to create a user interface for doctors to input patient data and display the results of the tumor detection. This project can have significant applications in the medical field and can aid doctors in the early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
